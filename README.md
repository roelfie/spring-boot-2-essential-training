# LinkedIn: Spring Boot 2 Essential Training

Playground for the Spring Boot 2 Essential Training from LinkedIn Learning

## Section 1.2: Spring Initializr

This Spring Boot application was created by the Spring [Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) and contains the starters Web, Actuator & Thymeleaf.

#### Ways to start a Spring Boot jar
During development you will usually start the application in IntelliJ IDEA (SpringBoot*Application.java).

In production you can:
- `java -jar ...`
- shell script (makes it easier to add environment variables and properties)
- `systemd` / `init.d` (on *nix systems) to let the server control when services start/stop
- cloud ecosystems (e.g. Pivotal Cloud Foundry)
  - `cf push` pushes a compiled JAR into cloud foundry and automatically runs it 

The embedded Tomcat runs HTTP / port 8080 by default.
```shell script
cd <project-root>
mvn clean package
java -jar target/spring-boot-essentials-1.0.0.jar
```

- Web application: http://localhost:8080
- REST endpoint: http://localhost:8080/api/greetings

## Section 1.5: Use profiles to specify server port

Server ports are configured in `application.yml`. Specify the active profile like this:
```shell script
java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=test target/spring-boot-essentials-1.0.0.jar
```

and the web application can be found at: http://localhost:9000

## Section 2.2: Configure server to use TLS/SSL

Generate a self-signed certificate in a local key store:
```shell script
keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias linkedin -keystore keystore.jks -storepass password -validity 4000 -keysize 2048
```

`application.yml` has been updated to use TLS/SSL. See also the [Spring Boot server properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/appendix-application-properties.html#server-properties).

Start the server without a profile, and the web application is now available under (with HTTPie):
```shell script
http --verify=no https://localhost:8080/api/greeting  
```

## Section 2.4: RESTful services with Spring Web MVC

Spring MVC supports JSON natively. 
All you need to create a RESTful service is a `@RestController` with a `@RequestMapping("/api/rooms")`.
This is all based on the same Spring Web MVC framework used to create web applications.

```shell script
http http://localhost:8080/api/rooms                          // HTTP 200 (JSON)
http http://localhost:8080/api/rooms Accept:application/xml   // HTTP 406 (Not Acceptable)
```  

To fix the HTTP 406 and get XML out of the web service, add an XML marshaller dependency, for instance:
```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat</groupId>
	<artifactId>jackson-dataformat-xml</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

## Section 2.5: Devtools

The [`spring-boot-devtools`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.3.x-SNAPSHOT/reference/html/using-boot-devtools.html) allow for automatically picking up changes on the classpath while the application is running (except for changes in class files). 
To make this work in IntelliJ
- open the Registry (âŒ˜-O / Actions / Registry...) and select `compiler.automake.allow.when.app.running`
- in the Preferences, under Compiler, select `Build project automatically`

#### Live Reload web pages

When you start the server you will see `LiveReload server is running on port 35729`. This will allow the web browser (with the appropriate plugin) 
to automatically refresh the web page when a change on the server is detected. 

In Chrome, use the Live Reload extension. You can activate it by clicking on the 'reload' icon :arrows_clockwise: in the browser toolbar.

## Section 3.1: Command-Line runner interface

Command Line Runners (CLRs) can be used to perform a single task, just once.
The task is defined as a bean (@Component) that implements the `CommandLineRunner` or the `ApplicationRunner` interface
(a single `.run()` method). The task is executed (just once) as soon as the ApplicationContext has started.

You can put CLRs in a standalone Spring Boot application (without any starters), or as part of an existing 
Spring Boot web application, messaging application, etc.

If you have more than one Runner in your application (or even ApplicationContext), you can use `@Order` to define the order in which they should be executed.

Typical use cases: 
* standalone CLRs
  - any standalone task that you want to automate using the Spring Framework.
* CLRs in existing Spring Boot applications
  - Verify data in a database at application startup
  - Priming an asynchronous message queue
  - Any other admin-type task ...

See [spring-boot-command-line-runner](https://github.com/roelfie/spring-boot-command-line-runner) for an example.

## Section 4.2: Spring Boot Data

If the following scripts exist on the classpath (`src/main/resources`) Spring Boot will use them to prime the database on startup:
```
schema.sql
data.sql
``` 

## Section 4.6: AMQP messaging with RabbitMQ

See [spring-boot-consumer](https://github.com/roelfie/spring-boot-consumer) for an example of a Spring Boot message consumer
and instructions on how to get RabbitMQ up and running.
