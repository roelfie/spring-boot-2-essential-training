# logging-timers

The **logging-timers** (called service-logging in the course) is a library that defines an `@Around` aspect for timing 
method calls and an `@Timed` annotation to effectuate that aspect.

It is used by [logging-spring-boot-autoconfigure](../logging-spring-boot-autoconfigure)
and [logging-spring-boot-starter](../logging-spring-boot-starter).
